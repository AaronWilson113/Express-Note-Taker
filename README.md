# Express-Note-Taker

## Description
This application is designed to create a easy and simple ui for user's to interact with and store important information in notes. The application takes in user data, storing it in a local database and then renders it to the page for easy access. Upon rendering the information, user's can then read the notes they have already created and delete them as well. This application was created with starter code from Uconn's full stack programming course. 

## Installation 
For installation you will need to open up the root of the project and then run npm i. 

## Usage
After running NPM i, open up localhost:3001 in the web browser of your choice, and your note taking page will be rendered.
